# # How to interact with this tutorial
# 
# Execute a code cell (the bounded rectangular block that has In[] written to it's left) by clicking on it
# and simultaneously pressing 'Shift+Enter'. 
# 
# # Variable
# ## Concept and Implementation
# In the following cell, enter a 6-digit number.

# In[1]:


#Enter some number below


# In the following cell, enter another 6-digit number.

# In[2]:


#Enter some number below


# In the cell below, add these numbers.

# In[3]:


#Enter some number below


# Now multiply the same two numbers.

# In[4]:


#Enter some number below


# Now, divide the same two numbers.

# In[5]:


#Enter some number below


# Gets quite boring and also tedious to keep rewriting these numbers over and over
# again, right? So you think to yourself: ''surely, computer peoples must have
# found a better way to handle this stuff?'' And, yes, they have! This is done by
# storing the numbers using some what is called a variable.

# In[6]:


#Enter some number below
a = 123456
b = 123455


# Now, you can repeat the above algebra operations more conveniently. Now, we can
# present a more formal definition of a variable.
# 
# <a id=’definition’></a>
# ## Definition
# A variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a
# variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
# 
# This is sufficient for us to work with [the Vectors Tutorial](NB_Tutorial_Vectors_ReferenceFrames.ipynb).
